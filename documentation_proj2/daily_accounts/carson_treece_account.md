**Time spent on project:** 4 hours

**Brief summary of what you did:** Implemented the hard AI, also fixed a bug in draw_gameover() where it would print that player 1 won even if the AI won the match.
                                    Implemented a function to print where the AIs have placed their ships, this was so I could make sure that gameover was outputting the correct stuff.
