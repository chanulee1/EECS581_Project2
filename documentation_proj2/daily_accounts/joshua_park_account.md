**Time spent on project:** 3.75 hours

**Brief summary of what you did:** I implemented the medium difficulty in a very verbose way. I will need to revisit it when Connor finishes his portion of the project with the ships of different shapes. It can definitely be simplified and optimized, I'll try to do that before Saturday. I also think that it should still be bug tested. I ran into a bug when placing the player ships at the edges of the screen it causes the AI ship placements to bug out and never finish. I have no clue why this might be.
